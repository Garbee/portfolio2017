I have been building websites since 1998, and have worked at University of Virginia since 2008: at the College and Graduate School of Arts & Sciences, Web Communications and currently at the University of Virginia Library. In early 2015 I founded a local Google Developer Group - GDG Central Virginia.

I have always been fascinated with technology, and find it to be an endless source for creative expression, whether it be for interactive media in it's various forms, musical compositions, or multimedia installations.

In my spare time, I am a lifelong musician, vinyl DJ, and run an international electro record label and online music magazine with my husband, Santino Fernandez. We live in a house on a pond near the Green Springs District in central Virginia. We affectionately call our humble abode 'Dragonfly Farm'.

I also sometimes take graduate level courses in the Music Composition and Computer Technologies program in the McIntire Department of Music at the University of Virginia.
